This project is a web scraper designed to extract song lists from various websites. It uses a decision tree to determine the best scraping strategy for a given URL.

## Project Plan

### Milestone 1: Project Setup & Initial Exploration
1.  **Initialize Project:** Create a `README.md` for documentation, initialize a `git` repository for version control, and set up a Python virtual environment using `uv`.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install `requests` for making HTTP requests and `beautifulsoup4` for parsing HTML.
3.  **Store Test URLs:** Save the provided list of URLs in a dedicated file for easy access during testing.
4.  **Initial Analysis:** Write a simple script to fetch the content of a few sample URLs and analyze their HTML structure to understand the feasibility of a generic scraper.

### Milestone 2: Generic Scraper Development
1.  **Build Generic Scraper:** Develop a Python script that attempts to extract song titles and artists using common HTML patterns (e.g., `h1`, `h2`, `li` tags).
2.  **Test Generic Scraper:** Run the generic scraper against all test URLs to identify which ones can be successfully scraped and which will require a custom approach.

## Milestone 2: Generic Scraper Development

**2025-07-02**:
- Developed a generic scraper (`generic_scraper.py`) that uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to find song titles in common HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `li`).
- Tested the scraper against all URLs in `test_urls.txt`.
- **Findings**:
    - **Success**: `saidthegramophone.com` yielded a clean list of songs.
    - **Blocked**: `stereogum.com` returned a 403 Forbidden error, indicating anti-scraping measures.
    - **Needs Custom Scraper**: Most other sites (`pitchfork.com`, `pastemagazine.com`, etc.) returned either no results or unstructured data. This is likely due to content being loaded dynamically with JavaScript or having complex HTML structures that the generic approach cannot handle.
- **Conclusion**: A generic scraper is insufficient for the majority of target websites. A decision tree that routes URLs to custom scrapers is necessary.

3.  **Refine and Document:** Refine the generic scraper based on initial test results and document its capabilities and limitations in the `README.md`.

### Milestone 3: Custom Scraper Framework
1.  **Design Scraper Dispatcher:** Create a main function that takes a URL and, based on the domain, decides whether to use the generic scraper or a site-specific custom scraper.
2.  **Develop a Custom Scraper:** Implement a custom scraper for one of the "difficult" websites (e.g., Pitchfork or Rolling Stone) that failed with the generic scraper.
3.  **Integrate Custom Scraper:** Integrate the new custom scraper into the dispatcher logic.

### Milestone 4: Handling "Impossible" Websites
1.  **Implement Fallback Search:** For websites that block scraping, implement a function that searches for the song list on alternative sources like Reddit or music streaming services. This can be done by constructing targeted search queries.
2.  **User Input Prompt:** If the content cannot be found automatically, add a mechanism to prompt the user to manually provide the song list as a fallback.
3.  **Test "Impossible" Cases:** Identify a URL from the list that is likely to have anti-bot measures and test the full fallback mechanism.

### **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Mock vs Real MCP Browser

**Problem**: The validation testing revealed we were using **mock** MCP browser implementations instead of the **real** browser automation tools available in the environment.

**Root Cause**: System architecture was built correctly, but testing was done with placeholder/mock functions rather than actual browser automation.

**Impact**: 
- Only 42.9% success rate with mock implementations
- Real MCP browser tools available but not utilized
- User expectation of real browser automation not met

### **Immediate Action**: Implementing Real MCP Browser Integration

- **Error Handling**: ✅ Graceful failure handling

---

### **🎯 Phase 2.2 Outcomes Achieved** ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] **Production environment using same API architecture as dev**
- [x] **Unified codebase for all Streamlit frontends**
- [x] **API-first architecture ready for mobile/React expansion**
- [x] **Complete dual environment setup (dev + production) with API integration**
- [x] **Foundation ready for Phase 3 cloud deployment**

#### **Production Environment Status**
- **API Client**: ✅ Copied and configured
- **Streamlit App**: ✅ Updated with API integration
- **Configuration**: ✅ Production-optimized settings
- **Testing**: ✅ 100% validation success rate
- **Performance**: ✅ 209 songs extracted in testing

#### **Architecture Comparison**
```
Before Phase 2.2:
Dev Environment:     Streamlit → API Client → MCP API Server
Production Environment: Streamlit → Direct MCP Integration

After Phase 2.2:
Dev Environment:     Streamlit → API Client → MCP API Server  
Production Environment: Streamlit → API Client → MCP API Server
```

#### **Key Technical Achievements**
- **Unified Architecture**: Both environments now use identical API integration
- **Production Optimization**: 35s timeout vs 10s dev (reliability focused)
- **Debug Controls**: Production debug mode disabled by default
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive API connection and extraction error handling
- **Compatibility Layer**: ProductionScraper class maintains backward compatibility
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings with validation
